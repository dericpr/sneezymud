A very devout deikhan may invoke the deities to directly intervene against
the deikhan's foes, smiting the opponent and causing it to suffer greatly.
The deikhan must channel the intervention through the use of any two handed
weapon.  Smiting stretches the deikhan's connection with her deities and
will leave the deikhan more vulnerable to attacks for several hours. During
this time the the deikhan may not attempt to smite again.
